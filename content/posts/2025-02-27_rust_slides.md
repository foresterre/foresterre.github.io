Today I rediscovered a slide deck I made for a lunch talk I gave at the beginning
of 2022. It is an introduction to Rust, and the features which made me fall in love
with Rust since 2014.

It was aimed at an engineering audience consisting of among others
software engineers, mechanical engineers and control systems engineers.
Everyone in the audience had at least some programming experience.

I decided to post it to my blog, in case anybody would like to use it for
inspiration, or would find it otherwise useful.

The slide deck can be found [here](/pdf/sneak_peek_into_rust.pdf).
