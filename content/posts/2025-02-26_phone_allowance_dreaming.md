# 100% battery allowance per month

Today I took the train to work. I watch mesmerizingly beautiful landscapes glittering in sunshine pass by.

But inside, all I see is people staring and scrolling at their phones.

So, I stare outside again, and let my imagination flow.

"Imagine a world where your phone battery would drain linearly. And would be upped instantly at the end of the month, like a data plan. Usage on a clock. What a place would that be."

Would we then use that battery all at once, or look more sparingly at our phones? Would trains be a place for conversation with strangers once more?
