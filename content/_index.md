Hello! I'm Martijn Gribnau. I'm a Software Engineer from The Netherlands. I love designing and writing software and am especially passionate about programming languages and the Rust programming language.

I publish, and maintain several Rust libraries and tools such as:
- [cargo-msrv](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv), a toolkit to find and verify the Minimal Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
- [yare](https://github.com/foresterre/yare) and [parameterized](https://github.com/foresterre/parameterized), two slim attribute macro's to write parameterized tests
- [bisector](https://github.com/foresterre/bisector), a stateless implementation of the bisection algorithm
- [storyteller](https://crates.io/crates/storyteller), an event based library for architecting user output
- [rust-releases](https://crates.io/crates/rust-releases), a crate to find which Rust toolchains have been published,
- [peekmore](https://github.com/foresterre/peekmore), a multi peek iterator adapter,
- [sic](https://github.com/foresterre/sic), an image processing CLI

... and [several](https://crates.io/users/foresterre?sort=recent-updates) others.

While my current favourite programming language is Rust, I also write software in
various other languages, such as TypeScript, Java and Python.
