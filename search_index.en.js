If you want to do the same in 0.16, you instead\nshould run cargo msrv find. The top level  cargo msrv action is no more.\nThere are two primary reasons to move this action to a subcommand instead of keeping it at the top level:\n\nConsistency: cargo msrv can do more than that tagline, and placing all actions on the subcommand level signals that\nthey're equals.\nUnsupported CLI flags and options: When actions are placed on two layers, and one of these layers is below the other,\nthen the bottom layer inherits its flags and options, even though they do not always overlap. For example, the set of\nCLI flags and options of cargo msrv find and cargo msrv list are not identical. cargo msrv find for example has\nan option called --release-source which should be present for cargo msrv find but not for cargo msrv list. If\ncargo msrv find would still be run as cargo msrv, you could also invoke this option for cargo msrv list, like\nso: cargo msrv --release-source rust-dist list. However, contextually, the --release-source option does not make\nsense for cargo msrv list, so previously it was ignored. By making cargo msrv find a subcommand like\ncargo msrv list, the flags and options which are not shared between all actions can be put solely below their own\nsubcommand.\n\nA consequence of (2) is that some unnecessary options and flags have been removed from the top level, and so this is a\nbreaking change, not just for cargo msrv find but also for cargo msrv list.\nMinor reasons for this change include that I can now talk about cargo msrv find as \"cargo msrv find\" instead of\ncargo msrv (find) or \"the top level command\". Plus, it addressed some difficulties around the code which does CLI\nparsing, about which I wrote in this\nprevious post. I'm glad I opted to go this route instead though 😅.\nThe UI part 1: output format options\nThe way the UI is rendered has been updated. Internally, it is now easier to add and maintain different output formats.\ncargo-msrv now supports 3 output formats:\n\nhuman (the default one, intended for the human eye)\njson (intended for machine readability)\nminimal (*new*, it was requested for environments where people only care about success/failure, such as CI)\n\nThe UI part 2: cargo msrv find and verify \"human\" output\nAs they say, \"a picture is a thousand words\":\nPreviously...\n\nNew...\n\nI'll be iterating the UI further in the future. Constructive feedback is more than welcome!\ncargo msrv find --write-msrv\nThis option will write the MSRV to your Cargo manifest:\n\ncargo msrv find --min and --max\nThe --min and --max options would previously only take three component semver versions like \"1.2.3\" or editions. It\nis common to specify the MSRV in a two component version like \"1.2\", so these are now also supported.\ncargo msrv verify --rust-version\ncargo msrv verify can be used to check whether your project is compatible with its MSRV. The MSRV is usually read from\nthe Cargo manifest (Cargo.toml). Sometimes it can be useful to provide it manually instead. That's where this option\ncomes in handy.\nIt should be noted that cargo-msrv does, at present, not unset any value you may have specified in the\nCargo manifest. So if you have a Cargo manifest with rust-version = \"1.56.0\" and supply the --rust-version option\nwith the value 1.55.0, the cargo project will (if the default options are used) fail to compile, and as a consequence\ncargo-msrv will report that your crate is not compatible with the specified MSRV.\nFetching the rust releases index\nThe rust releases index, the thing we use to figure out which Rust versions exist, are now only fetched when a\nsubcommand needs it (currently cargo msrv find and cargo msrv verify).\nThe changelog\nThe complete changelog can be found here.\nThanks!\nThanks to all contributors, whether you submitted a PR or reported\nan issue, or contributed in some other way.\nSome of your issues and PR's really made my day! 💛\n","description":"","id":"https://gribnau.dev/posts/cargo-msrv-0-16/","title":"A few cargo-msrv 0.16 release highlights"},"https://gribnau.dev/posts/finding-security-advisories/":{"body":"Four days ago, news came in that several packages on NPM were compromised; later it turned out to that it wasn't just one NPM account that was compromised by the (it seems) the same phishing attack, but multiple. The compromised accounts published new package versions containing malware which intercepted network traffic and replaced crypto wallet addresses with alternative malicious addresses. Various popular packages were affected, such as chalk and debug-js via Qix's NPM account, and duckdb via the duckdb_admin NPM account.\nThe malware and compromised accounts (at least the one's we know of) was fairly quickly detected and actions were taken over the next few days to prevent the malicious NPM packages from being installed by downstream users. Props to all involved in the effort, and the open communication!\nFinding the security advisories\nNow yesterday, I wanted to find the security advisories for the affected packages for a report at my day job. This turned out to be not as easy as I expected. Simply searching for, e.g. chalk on the GitHub Advisory Database page gave me four results, three of which were sort of related, but none of them was the security issue in Chalk itself. I thought for a moment they maybe would have issued only a \"top level\" kind of advisory linked to e.g. the debug package, since that repo was used as a central location to file most of the responses, but no luck (this sometimes happens when there is a CVE which links multiple packages, like in the case of the compromised DuckDB packages. Changing the type to unreviewed in case they would be filtered out by default gave even less results (0).\n\nThen I tried searching via the repo's themselves, for example chalk and debug. These seem to be exclusive to information posed by the maintainers, which in this case opted to use different channels as there is nothing there.\nHowever, good news! They do exist! I have no idea how I should have found them without going through GitHub's own advisory-database repo though, which is not exactly setup to be searched by humans directly. This repo also hosts these two related issues, which both contain partial lists with links to the specific advisories.\nAs examples, here are the advisories for:\n\nchalk, and\ndebug\n\nIf I have to guess, then I would guess the advisories only show up after package maintainers have approved it from a security dashboard; but I am not sure.\nNow, another reason why the search may be so difficult, is that there doesn't seem to be a CVE for most packages (I couldn't find one, for example chalk again). DuckDB however does have one, and prebid-js has two.\nI'm unfamiliar with the process and can see that there are pratical limitations, not only because there are many parties involved and distributed over the world, but also because there are many different places where relevant info is posted, and a reasonable way to link from a root page may not be that obvious.\nStill, I feel that the way the information is published, presented and made searchable can be improved, for example by giving maintainers a more central way to publish status updates (i.e. written text) for multiple packages at once.\nNext time I would go directly to the github/advisory-database repository, as it is unclear to me why some bits of information are not shown from the Advisories page. While writing the post I found that GitHub's security advisories documentation are probably hidden under explicit use of the type:malware tag by default, because \"most of the vulnerabilities cannot be resolved by downstream users\". This is, I assume, also why DuckDB's advisory does show up; it is not tagged under malware (but posted to DuckDB's duckdb-node repo, and also has a CVE, i.e. CVE-2025-59037).\nI don't know yet whether hiding malware typed advisories by default is a practice I like. I definitely don't like that I this is non-obvious from the advisories page itself.\nStill, most of my critique stands: finding the right information fast is difficult, and the way advisories are posted is different per package.\nWhen NPM deletes packages\nThe second thing I felt can be improved is the way [npmjs.org] removes affected packages. I consider it a good practice to remove the packages to reduce amount of affected downstream users. However, from the website, it is not clear why the package was removed (or whether it existed ever).\nTake for example chalk.\nThe NPM website currently lists the following version history (I'll only list the last few packages):\n\nNB: It doesn't matter whether you tick the \"show deprecated versions\" box.\nFrom this page, you have no idea that 5.6.1 was ever published and subsequently removed.\nI think it would be an improvement to show the version, and mark it explicitly as \"removed\", so users are not left guessing. That would help you in your search to find context about why it was removed. More information like related advisories would be a bonus.\nLuckily, you will find the reason for the removal reported through the CLI, which is a good thing. However, if you use e.g. renovate bot (the open source version), you could have merged a PR to update the package without ever having installed the package yourself (and subsequently not have seen the notice), perhaps even because the PR was created before the infected package was noticed by anyone. It is that easy to end up with a deployed release affected with malware.\nMy critiques for both these issues are quite the same: the way information is presented when it is critical is not yet where it could be. Of course there are many vendors which offer scanners for packages and package ecosystems, which maybe offer some central way to access information about the compromise. Still, sometimes you also need more specific or end-use information, if possible from the source. I hope that the future will bring better tooling or presentations to quickly assess vulnerability situations, even before a post-mortem took place.\n","description":"","id":"https://gribnau.dev/posts/finding-security-advisories/","title":"Where are the security advisories of the recently compromised NPM packages?"},"https://gribnau.dev/posts/forgotten-brackets/":{"body":"Every project needs a changelog. And let's be honest, the work keep-a-changelog did to make this a more common practice is awesome. But there is something many seem to forget: Did you ever notice [version numbers] in release titles within a CHANGELOG.md? These brackets were supposed to be links. But in reference style, you need to complete the reference elsewhere. Let's look at an example (also in the wild):\n\nThis snippet, produces the following output:\n\n[0.18.3] - 2025-04-19\n\nLost: references to version numbers\n\n\nHowever, if you scroll to the bottom of the keep-a-changelog example, you can see that the version numbers in brackets, have their link completed at the bottom. And rendered, it looks like this.\nSo how do we fix our changelog? By adding reference style links:\n\nThis produces the following output:\n\n0.18.4 - 2025-04-19\n\nFound: references to version numbers\n\n\nDon't like linking to the diff?\nNot a problem.

Or just leave the brackets out:\n\n0.18.5 - 2025-04-19\n\nAlso good: This version number has no link\n\n\nCall to action\nSo next time you write a changelog, please keep these digital tumbleweeds out.

Both the website and GitHub repository are a bit sparse on how to use it, but they do link to all sorts of integrations, which I think all use the Harper language server. There is also harper.js, mostly for web applications and browser extensions.\nWhile the language server (or harper.js) is great for extensive editor use, I sometimes just want to quickly check a file for spelling and grammatical issues. As it turns out, this is already possible by using the harper-cli tool.\nThis CLI is not documented on the documentation website, probably, as I found out later, because it is still listed as an experimental frontend.

Each set of inputs is a separate test case.\nFor example:\n\nThe above scenario will generate 3 test cases: apple, pear and blackberry, while it was only necessary to specify the\nscenario once.\nAs you might imagine, if your add more tests, the removal of duplicated test cases does not only save\nwriting (and maintenance!) time, but makes it also easier to keep scenarios the same for a large set of inputs (especially\nwhile refactoring code, changes to test scenarios may sneak in, which should also have applied to equivalent inputs).\nWhat's new in 3.0.0\nCustom test macro (e.g. tokio::test)\nPrior to 3.0.0, Yare would always generate test cases with the Rust built in #[test] attribute. While it is exceptionally\nuseful to have this macro built in, at times you may want to use a different macro because the built-in one doesn't support\na feature you need.\nA common example is the tokio::test macro, when using the tokio\nasynchronous runtime. While you could create your own Runtime\nand spawn futures onto this runtime for your test cases, it is perhaps not as elegant as using the tokio::test\nmacro.\nWith this use case in mind, Yare can now be used with user specified test macro's. If none is specified, the Rust built-in\n#[test] will be used.\nExample\n\nHow does it work?\nTo make this work, the #[parameterized(...)] attribute in Yare parses all attributes placed after it (all attributes must be placed on top of the\ntest function):\n\nSo for the following Rust source code:\n\nWe end up with 1 test_macro attribute and 1 \"normal\" attribute (i.e. not test_macro):\n\nIn the code generation phase, we can obtain these separately from TestFn:\n\nAnd finally during generation itself:\n\nWhen the code generation phase of the macro has been completed, the parameterized test function will have been substituted by two separate test functions:\n\nGotchas to be aware of\nThe #[test_macro(...)] attribute must be placed after #[parameterized]\nLike all macro's, yare::parameterized can only parse the available scope. Since yare::parameterized is supposed\nto be placed on top of functions, we can access our own attribute (which we use to parse the test case identifier and arguments for test cases)\nand the function underneath (used to specify the parameters and test scenario in the function body).\nWhile yare::parameterized does have access to attributes placed after it, the ones which come before it, are inaccessible.\nSubsequently, yare::parameterized can only recognize placements of #[test_macro(...)] which come after it.\nSo, the following is ok:\n\nWhile this doesn't work:\n\nOne #[test_macro(...)] per parameterized test function\nYare currently accepts one #[test_macro(...)] for a parameterized test function. The following is not allowed and will return an error:\n\nReturned error:\n\nThe reason is that it's unclear what should happen when multiple #[test_macro(...)] attributes are present.\nShould the first one be used by  #[parameterized(...)], and subsequent be left in place? Or would that just be\nconfusing, if only because the test author will need to keep track of which macro uses which attributes.\nRenaming attributes\nYare's parameterized attribute can be used with a different name if you would like, by rebinding the target import\npart under a local name:\n\nHowever, since the #[test_macro(...)] is parsed by yare::parameterized, it cannot be renamed.\nExtended function qualifier support\nPreviously, when Yare was still written to support mostly just the built-in #[test] macro, it wasn't so useful to\nsupport the function qualifiers: const, async, unsafe and extern. Firstly, because half of these aren't even\nsupported by #[test]. For the ones that are, namely const and extern, the I deemed the usefulness to be limited.\nFor example: with const you can't use the commonly used assert_eq! since the PartialEq trait is not marked as const. And regarding extern, I've never seen anyone call unit test functions over FFI (but if you do, I would like to know, it does sound fun 😅).\nHowever, with custom test macro's, you want at least support for async and maybe for unsafe. Adding the other two is hardly more work, so I also added const and extern for completeness.\nNB: when specifying one ore more qualifiers in the function definition of your test function, the underlying test macro (whether #[test] or a custom macro #[test_macro(x)]) must also support the specified qualifiers.\nExample\n\nIdeas, feedback and bug reports for Yare\nIdeas, feedback and bug reports are most welcome.

And a short introduction to cargo msrv\nThe problem\nIn cargo-msrv we have the following situation. The top level command is used when \"finding the MSRV\" of a Rust project, while a subcommand can be used to verify that a specific MSRV works for a given project.\nThe former can be done by running cargo msrv while the latter would be cargo msrv verify.\nOnce upon a time, an issue was reported that cargo msrv --target x verify worked, but cargo msrv verify --target x did not. Another Cargo tool used by the reporter, together with cargo-msrv, would always specify the latter form, so the former could not be used as a workaround.\nWhile diving into this issue I figured, this should work:\n\ncargo msrv --target x verify\ncargo msrv verify --target x (equivalent to 2 for the user)\n\nBut this should not:\n\ncargo msrv --target x verify --target y\n\nThe latter form is confusing to a user. If you allow both, you have to consider which takes precedence. Or whether they define the same thing.\nThis should also not work (since the list subcommand currently doesn't use the target CLI argument at all):\n\ncargo msrv --target x list\ncargo msrv list --target x\n\nThis post describes a short journey into the search for a satisfying solution.\ncargo-msrv uses clap, the most commonly used CLI argument parser (in the Rust library landscape). For the remainder of this post I will assume some familiarity with Rust and clap.\nBackground on cargo msrv\nThis section can be useful to better understand this post since I decided to keep the original problem, instead of describing a more minimal reproduction. But feel free to skip this section (I might refer back to it though 😜).\nA short history\ncargo-msrv was originally born out of a desire to find the MSRV for a Rust project (more specifically package). MSRV stands for \"minimal supported Rust version\" and is the earliest or oldest version supported by a Rust project. For different projects this may mean different things, but for this post I will consider \"support\" as \"does compile with a Rust toolchain of a certain version\".\nFast forward a few years, and the MSRV has become somewhat more ubiquitous which can also be seen by its inclusion into Cargo as the rust-version. Over time some additional tools were added to cargo-msrv. One of these was the cargo msrv verify subcommand.\nThis subcommand can be used to check whether a Rust project supports its defined MSRV (e.g. via this rust-version field in the Cargo manifest). For example, in a CI pipeline you can use this to check whether your project works for the version you promised to your users.\nOriginally, I kept the cargo msrv top level command aside from the subcommands for backwards compatibility reasons. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have done that, but as is, their coexistence at least provides me with the opportunity to write this blog post 😅.\nHow cargo msrv works\nI described the \"support\" from \"minimal supported Rust version\" (MSRV) above as the somewhat simplified \"does compile with a Rust toolchain of a certain version\".\nYou may write that as a function like so:  fn is_compatible(version) -&gt; bool. If you run this test for some Rust version, when the function produces the value true, then we consider the Rust version to be supported. If instead the function produces the value false, then the Rust version is not supported.\ncargo msrv specifically searches for the minimal Rust version which is supported by a given Rust project. While there are some caveats, we build upon Rust's stability promise . In our case that is the idea that Rust versions are backwards compatible.\nFor a simple example to determine an MSRV, you can linearly walk backwards from the most recent Rust version to the earliest. When your project doesn't compile for a specific Rust version, then the last version that did compile can be considered your MSRV.\nLet's make it a bit more concrete with an example. For this example, we assume that Rust the following Rust versions exist: 1.0.0 up to and including 1.5.0.\nConsider a project which uses the Duration API which was stabilised by Rust 1.3.0 (and nothing more recent 😉).\nThen, if you would compile this project with Rust version from most recent to least recent, you would expect the following to happen:\n\nis_compatible(Rust 1.5.0) returns true ✅\nis_compatible(Rust 1.4.0) returns true ✅\nis_compatible(Rust 1.3.0) returns true ✅\nis_compatible(Rust 1.2.0) returns false ❌ (\"Duration is not stable\")\nis_compatible(Rust 1.1.0) returns false ❌\nis_compatible(Rust 1.0.0) returns false ❌\n\nSince we only care about the minimal Rust version, you could have stopped searching after compiling Rust 1.2.0; Rust 1.3.0 was the earliest released Rust version which worked.\nIn reality doing a linear search is quite slow (at the time of writing, there are 79 minor versions), so we primarily use a binary search instead to incrementally reduce the search space.\ncargo msrv verify works quite similar to \"finding the MSRV\", but instead of running a search which produces as primary output the MSRV, in this case the MSRV is already known in advance. So given a MSRV of 1.3.0 we just run the is_compatible(Rust 1.3.0) function once. If it returns true we can say that the 1.3.0 is an acceptable MSRV (although not necessarily strictly so). More importantly, if it returns false, then the specified version is actually not supported, and thus can not be an MSRV).\nEnough background, back to the post.\nDefinition of the CLI\ncargo-msrv uses clap as its CLI argument parser. It nowadays uses the macro derive based API. In the code blocks below, I have isolated the primary definition of the CLI which describes the cargo msrv top level command (a.k.a. Find in the code), and the cargo msrv verify subcommand.\nI've taken the liberty to remove some unnecessary details, and added some arrows and comments for relevant items. Otherwise, this code is the copied directly from the actual source.\n\nCargoMsrvOpts is the top level CLI interface, i.e. cargo msrv.\nThe options relevant to \"finding the MSRV\" are specified on the top level (i.e. FindOpts).\nFindOpts should not be used for other subcommands (ironic considering this post, I know, at least cargo msrv verify --help doesn't list them 😜).\n\nOptions supplied to the verify subcommand are specified by the VerifyOpts struct. As a user, you would interface with it like so: cargo msrv verify {opts}, e.g. cargo msrv verify --target example.\n\nRunnerOpts specifies options relevant to run the is_compatible test I introduced in the How cargo msrv works section. What this actually entails is not relevant to this post. All you need to know is that each of these flattened commands define some arguments. I will use the arguments in ToolchainOpts for the examples:  --target (as my primary example) and --add-component (just to point out some edge cases).\nThe last detail I will add is that for both the \"find msrv\" top level command and each of the subcommands, we produce a flattened context which contains the inputs for that command. Both the FindContext and VerifyContext contain a pub toolchain: ToolchainContext field. The context is currently created via the TryFrom trait from the Opts (or resolved from the environment) to the Context.\nThe fields in the ToolchainContext can be considered static for the duration of the program.\nThe goal\nLet's make the problem a bit more concrete again.\nFirst lets be explicit: the problem is limited to \"matching (in name and type) CLI arguments which can be provided to both cargo msrv and cargo msrv verify\", and I'll mention that if no value is given for either, we use some default which we will assume just exists.\nIn the end, (1) we want to end up with a CLI interface like cargo msrv {top_level_arg} verify {subcommand_arg} where a matching argument is provided to either the top level xor the subcommand xor use the default.\nIn addition, (2) the matching args should not be available to subcommands, other than verify.\nIn the next section, I'm going to throw some ideas over the wall. To generate these ideas I primarily used the clap rustdoc documentation on docs.rs as a reference.\nLet me spoil it for you  in advance 🙄: None of these solutions really make me happy, so I will probably choose a pragmatic choice instead.\nI mention this beforehand because I want to explicitly state that none of this is something I blame on clap (or anyone else). clap's documentation is extensive, and is very well written. If it is described, then I didn't look in the right places. It might just be a puzzle I haven't solved yet 🧩.\nAlso, this scenario where you have a top level CLI and some subcommands which have to share some things is most likely non standard, and honestly, discouraged for similar reasons as why I'm putting this effort in: user experience.\nIdea 1: merging Opts\nA first idea is to keep the current definition and simply merge its values.\nYou may see some obvious flaws with this: first, goal (2) will not be met, since one of the RunnerOpts is defined on FindOpts which is at the top level of the CLI, so subcommands other than verify will also have allow the arguments defined by RunnerOpts to be specified (even though they will be ignored). Second, goal (1) is dependent on custom merging logic.\nFor this, let's quickly consider the output which we would get from clap after it parsed the CLI arguments like in this idea (in simplified Rust code), to consider what it would look like:\n\nIf opts.subcommand is not Some(VerifyOpts(_)) then we can simply take all arguments from the find_toolchain_opts.\nIf opts.subcommand is Some(VerifyOpts(_)), then we would need to merge find_toolchain_opts and verify_toolchain_opts.\nMost of this merging code would likely be fairly trivial considering the limited common CLI input options and the XOR-or-default condition that clap would enforce if this concept worked.\n\nValues which are marked as optional, i.e. via the Option&lt;T&gt; type are trivial. If one is Some, then the other one must be None (by the  XOR-or-default condition).\nValues which instead use a default value, may not be so clear cut. There is the question: did the user provide this default value, or was it omitted. The first case is a choice, similar to Some, while the second case is a fallback to a default like None. This information is no longer known after argument parsing.\nThe good news however is that we only need to compare two values per field. Consider enum Choice { #[default] A, B, C }. Since we know that at most only one of the two values was provided, since if our idea works, the argument parser rejects if the user provides both.\nFrom an external point of view,  there are four options A (default), A (provided), B and C. However, we have to decide on a merged value for each pair just using their values A, B and C.  If values B or C, on both find xor verify, are given it is simple: by the XOR-or-default condition, B and C are always the user selected values. For A, we luckily do actually not need to care whether it was provided or not. If the other side provides B or C, it was the default (see previous), and if it is A, then we can simply use A.\n-&gt; I feel the merging/selecting would likely be reasonably possible with this fairly simple scenario in mind, but haven't put much thought into searching counter arguments where it doesn't work (or proving that it always works for that matter).\n\nYet, it would still all be a bit too hairy for my liking considering we use the derive API to get a nice declarative, clean looking argument parser.\nPositives:\n\nThe code (likely) compiles\nThe interface becomes no worse than it is today\n\nNegatives:\n\nCustom merging logic on top of the declarative API\n\nCurrently my preferred choice, mostly because it won't worsen the current user experience.\nIdea 2: naming a command\nIf we could name one of these derived commands, then we might get away with saying to clap:  \"the fields within this named command are incompatible with the fields in this other named command\"; i.e. I'm trying to apply some constraint.\n\nUnfortunately, this idea doesn't quite cut it. Deriving flatten and supplying an id at the same time is not allowed:\n\n--\nIf this idea would have worked, we also would still need to merge the Opts together, like in the last example.\nThe other reason why this idea is doomed is that when you put the id on the whole group of arguments, I suspect that once you give any argument in either the top level or the subcommand, all other values in the group must also be from the same group; otherwise they would be considered in conflict.\nConsidering cargo msrv {group_top_level} verify {group_subcommand},  then cargo msrv --target x --add-component y verify or cargo msrv verify  --target x --add-component y would be fine, but mixing it up like  cargo msrv --target x verify --add-component y would be in conflict.\nPositives:\n\nI can dream about a declarative only solution\nMaybe this would work on an argument level?\n\nI haven't tried that yet\n\n\n\nNegatives:\n\nDoesn't compile\nLikely wouldn't work in the first place\nIf it did, it would likely work per whole group, so I would have to use a group per argument\n\nIdea 3: Separate structs, groups and conflicts\nI also wanted to try a variation on the previous idea: this idea instead provides two 'separately' nameable things, which then  can be marked to be in conflict with one another.\nWe only let the top level variant be in conflict with the subcommand variant, since the latter cannot exist without the former.\n\nHowever, running results in:\n\nThere's probably a logical explanation here why this doesn't work; I guess I don't properly understand how ArgGroup works...\nNeutral:\n\nI don't seems to understand ArgGroup properly yet\n\nIdea 4: global = true\nThis was the first idea I had when I read the originally reported issue. It will again not satisfy goal (2), because marking a command as global, makes it, well, available to all subcommands.\nThis could however be a pragmatic choice, since in the current form they're already present via the top level FindOpts.\n\nWhen I looked at this idea in more detail, I actually found that this may be considered slightly worse since cargo msrv list --target x would be valid when global = true, while the current form 'only' allows cargo msrv --target x list (the residue of having the FindOpts at the top level). Plus, the current form does, for better or worse, not show the FindOpts help text when providing --help on the subcommand: i.e. cargo msrv verify --help.\nNow, it also doesn't really satisfy goal (1). For example: cargo msrv --add-component a --add-component b --target x verify --add-component c --add-component d --target y , produces:\n\nWhile,  cargo msrv --target x --add-component a verify --add-component b --target y --target z ,  does result in :\nerror: the argument '--target &lt;TARGET&gt;' cannot be used multiple times\nPositives:\n\nThe code compiles\nMost simple scenarios work\nIt doesn't need hairy merging code (on the surface)\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe interface will allow additional ignored arguments for subcommands other than verify\n\nThis list can grow large if all of RunnerOpts arguments are included\n\n\nMixed usage does not limit the num_args for Args on a global level\nMixed usage overwrites values specified on a deeper subcommand level\n\nBehaviour can possibly be changed with ArgAction (?)\nThis wouldn't be a problem if on a global level  it is possible to enforce that arguments could be only provided to one level / for non collection types, that the num_args would be complied with on the global level\n\n\nMixed usage is unintuitive for a user\n\nRemarks on using Clap\nIn this likely non-standard use case.\nClap's API surface\nClap has grown quite the set of options. There's something for everyone. It may very well still be possible to fulfill the use case I described above. Just because I couldn't find it after searching for it for a while doesn't mean it doesn't exist. In the end, I  decided to choose pragmatic over pure.\nSkip\nMany attributes define the magic skip option. It is available for ArgGroup and Arg. It is not available to Command in general (a variation with different behaviour is on Subcommand).\nAt first it sounded like  logical name for the something I'm looking for, however it ignores fields and sets a provided expression (or Default::default if omitted), so this doesn't feel like it works.\nAside: what kind of expression should I even put in, even if it fulfilled my use case; you would need to be able to refer to something which ought to be skipped. In my case that would be conditionally skipping if the subcommand is Some(s) where S is not Verify\nCommand::args_conflicts_with_subcommands\nFor a second, I hoped that if a command could be marked with  args_conflicts_with_subcommands  we could then reject all\nsubcommands which are not verify, but this method args_conflicts_with_subcommands(...) takes a bool;  not a list of subcommands... 😭, and has another use case altogether...\nShared value state\nAt some point I had a fleeting wish that there could be a GroupArg (or something else altogether) where values share their state.\nI.e. given a group G, defined on the top level as G_t and on a subcommand as G_s, when setting a value  for G_t or G_s, their value state would be shared. Still just this would not solve the most prominent problem, i.e. for the user we want to explicitly allow just one of each argument for any i in G_i to be defined...\nI suppose, this is not dissimilar to global = true on Args, except for some action override since global = true doesn't work intuitively by default for args defined on mixed levels.\nDerive and groups\nWhen using derive, it is not always straightforward to get an Arg from a group, since we have the derived structs; not ArgMatches. With ArgMatches you can, if I understand the documentation correctly, get the value of the group using one of the get_{} methods on ArgMatches.\nPossibly I could hack this together by using ArgAction::set with Command::args_override_self(true) ..?\nI still think I don't really understand the true value of ArgGroup. The \"a group of shared commands\" I was looking for is probably something else entirely. 😉\nConclusion\nIf you, dear reader, by any chance know how to solve the issue of this post, or have other ideas: I love to learn (about them). You also send me a mail, or contact me in another way, see my GitHub profile.\nIn the mean time, I suppose that this just isn't the way forward. To meet goal (2) in particular, having some shared arguments also at the top level makes solving the issue a lot harder. I tried to add constraints on how this definition could be used, but none of these really worked out.\nMaybe it is finally time to sunset the cargo msrv top level command and introduce a dedicated subcommand for \"find your msrv\" instead.\np.s. I kind of wrote this all on a whim, so it may be full of mistakes 🫧.\nThanks!\nThis post is based on an issue originally reported by Finomnis , thanks!\n","description":"","id":"https://gribnau.dev/posts/puzzle-sharing-declarative-args-between-top-level-and-subcommand/","title":"Puzzle: Sharing declarative args between top level and subcommand using Clap"},"https://gribnau.dev/posts/rust-slides/":{"body":"Today I rediscovered a slide deck I made for a lunch talk I gave at the beginning\nof 2022.

Everything went smoothly, so big props to the organisers, volunteers*, the audio and video crew, and staff at the venue. Also shoutout to the people who designed and organized the stickers, they're really really great, and also to the excellent barista coffee ☕.\n\nThe day ended for me by attending the live recording of the Rust in Production podcast in which Matthias Endler interviewed Niko Matsakis about his experiences of building Rust over the past 10 years, and by attending the live recording of another podcast titled 'Accessibility and Rust' (which if I recall correcly will be published on the Rustacean Station). In this podcast Luuk van der Duim was joined by Matt Campbell and Arnold Loubriat to talk about their experience of working on libraries and tooling to make graphical user interfaces (GUI's) more accessible. Both sessions were excellent. I wanted to take a moment to say a few words about the second one, which really spoke to me.\nDuring the podcast Matt and Arnold give some insight into how they \"see\" graphical computer programs, and also how they often can't because of shortcomings or lack of accessibility in programs. From a software engineering point of view, I have a feeling, we often shove accessibility features under the rug because of a percieved lack of business need, cost or complexity, so I'm happy there are people working on lowering the barrier.\nThis talk also addressed another possible reason (applified by the audience after the recording session), that for many developers who don't use assistive technologies like screenreaders, it's opaque how to build software that is accessible. On top of that, there is also the question of how to test whether you did it right, given you're not a regular user of assistive technologies.\nAccessKit tries to help solve the first question, and has amongst others, been used to improve accessibility support for Slint, a GUI toolkit**.\nFor the second question, I hope people will support their work and perhaps provide funding to them (or others) to develop a general test suite or framework which can be used by implementers of accessibility libraries***. In the mean time, I found that there is an introduction on the topic over at MDN, which has a particular focus on accessibility for webpages, but also includes a more general introduction.\nMatt will give a talk about AccessKit tomorrow at 10:25 local time (main track).

I have to admit: I briefly considered\nto use React Query, but decided it wasn't quite time\nfor that yet. Simple first. Complex later.\nI looked at the React Native\ndocs in an attempt for figure out what the canonical way of doing this was. The docs told me: \"hey, you can use\nthe Timers module which contains setInterval and clearInterval\". Just what I needed!\nsetInterval executes a callback after a given milliseconds delay. It doesn't have the option to\nimmediately fire, however. Luckily it's not hard to work around this: for example by\njust executing the function provided in the callback first.\nAs an alternative, MDN\nsuggested that you could also use setTimeout, although in my case, the execution duration is shorter than the interval\nfrequency, so I figured everything should be fine 🤞.\nTo give an idea of what the code looked like:\n\nNow one of the most useful features of React Native, is its ability to live inspect changes you just made.\nRunning the Metro development server in combination with a debug build of the app gives you\nlive updates out of the box. For me, that's simply running npm run start to start Metro and in a second\nterminal tab npm run android to build a debug build of the app and install it on a device (or emulator).\nNow, changes made to components or other code can be updated, and the changes can be observed on the app without\nrebuilding. Great!\nOne day, I was checking the logs in the Metro terminal app, and I there seemed to be a few too many fetches to the backend.\nNormally, it should refetch the resource every 10 seconds or so (or immediately after certain actions), now it was\nmaking requests to fetch the resource tens of times per second. Whoops.\nSo what happened? The callback in useEffect was being rerendered after each change in the code. And as a result, the\nsetInterval function was being rerun as well. On repeat. Oops 😅.\nLuckily, it can be fixed! As it turns out, setInterval can return a clean up function, which runs when the component\nunmounts (or when the props get updated and the dependencies provided to the useEffect have been changed, or even every rerender\nif no dependency array is provided):\n\nNote that the dependency array can be empty, since we only want to disable the fetch task if the component is unmounted.\nOtherwise it can just do its thing and fetch the resource at each specific interval.

It was stabilized in Rust 1.13.0, but prototyped via the try! macro some time before that. I can truthfully say that every time I write in another language, I miss that ? and the associated Try trait (I kind of wish the trait was marked stable 😅).\n\nThe time where a large portion of the community was on nightly by default is now far in the past. With the vision doc for Rust taking shape, and likely hundreds of other improvements, I can't wait for the next 10 years of stable Rust.\n","description":"","id":"https://gribnau.dev/posts/thank-you-all-for-ten-years-of-stable-rust/","title":"Thank you all for 10 years of (stable) Rust"},"https://gribnau.dev/posts/todo-macro-rust/":{"body":"Let's sketch a situation. You're designing and implementing a library in Rust, for some great idea you had. And, you aim to create a seamless API that makes this library user-friendly not only for others, but also for yourself.\nOne way to figure out the design of the library is to write a prototype, and write the bare minimum code to stub out the the initial API.\nI hear you think: Rust is not to most convenient prototyping language, because it's quite strict and verbose: we have to satisfy the borrow checker and, in many places, Rust requires you to explicitely type your code. And altough I believe both will help you design better code, I can also understand the argument that it reduces the prototyping velocity at least a bit.\nLuckily for us, the Rust standard library has a useful tool in its toolbox: the todo! macro.\nLet's look at an example. Imagine1 we're re-designing a Rust API to fetch Rust releases metadata.\nWe will first prototype a few data structures around the concept of \"releases\":\n\nNow, let's consider how we want to use the data captured by these data structures.\nFor example, we may want to find the most recently released Rust release:\n\nSee that todo! macro 😃? Instead of providing an actual, or fake, implementation which needs to satisfy the return type of our method, we placed a todo! macro in the body.\nThis allows us to not worry about our implementation just yet, so we can focus on the design of our API instead.\nIt also accepts the same arguments as panic!, so the following will work as well:\n\nIf we run the find_component method, we'll find that it panics the thread, and shows the panic message we provided, prefixed with \"not yet implemented\":\n\nUnder the hood, todo! is the same as panic!, to which it defers its implementation, but with a clear change of semantics: this bit is not yet implemented, but we'll do so soon.\nEvery rose has its thorn\nLet's expand our design and add a few more useful methods:\n\nIn the above code we defined two methods on Release, which both return an iterator of &amp;rust_toolchain::Component items.\nWhat happens if we try to compile the code above?:\n\n😢\nIt turns out, there is an issue where the compiler is unable to figure out what type to use for types which have the never type as their return type and use impl Trait in return position. The  todo! macro falls in this category.\nThere are several ways to work around the problem though.\nOne option is to use dynamic dispatch and box:\n\nAnother is to return a simple concrete type:\n\nA third is to use the explicit type in the return type, but this requires you to think ahead on which iterator type you will be using, which you probably don't want to worry about (especially if you will be using impl Iterator on implementation). A fourth would be to implement Iterator for a concrete type, but this also adds a lot of boilerplate.\nA fifth was suggested by natalialt. I like this one very much, because it is short and to the point (altough also not universably applicable to any impl Trait return type). This solution returns an iterator via the std::iter::once() function:\n\nThe reason that this works, is because std::iter::once returns a valid iterator, namely Once, which makes the return type satisfiable. Where the never type ! didn't implement Iterator, Once does.\nTaking it to the next level\nSo far, we saw that todo! can be a powerful prototyping tool. If we want to take it to the next level,\nwe should start making use of Rust's type checking capabilities for the composition and usage of our API.\nThis helps us be much more confident throughout designing of the library.\nAs shown before, the compiler knows that we do not need to satisfy our return types (within the method body).\nHowever, the return type of these methods will still be checked wherever we use these methods.\nThis allows us to not only define the new API, while leaving the implementation for later but also write some code on how to use it.\nThis can be particularly useful to explore whether an API is easy to use as a caller.\nI like to do this by writing unit tests for my API. If your API is painful to use, you're much more likely to find this out if you had to write\na usage example yourself. Plus, this way you also already have a first test in place. Example:\n\nAnd if we were not yet sure how to construct an input for our function under test, we can also use the todo! macro here:\n\nAlternatively, instead of writing inline unit tests, you could also use doctests for this purpose:\n\nImplementation time!\nOnce we are satisfied with the basic structure of our API, we can gradually replace each todo! macro with an actual implementation. We do not have to replace all the macros simultaneously, so we can focus on one implementation step at a time. Developing a well-designed API requires careful planning and attention to detail. Taking the time to establish a solid foundation will pay off in the long run, as it will result in  more user-friendly and reliably designed API.\nFootnotes\n1 I'm currently working on the next version of rust-releases.\nThanks!\nSpecial thanks to Chris Langhout, Jean de Leeuw and Martijn Steenbergen for proofreading my blog post; any mistakes are solely mine.\nAlso many thanks to proudHaskeller on Reddit for reporting an issue I missed: the type signature I initially used to deal with the todo! and impl Trait would never type check with a concrete implementation (this has been addressed), and to natalialt on Reddit for suggesting a useful workaround to the same issue when the return type is impl Iterator, by using iter::once(todo!()).\nDiscuss\nDiscussions and feedback are most welcome!
